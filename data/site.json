Now, it's becoming something else - your community, your home. From the start, we wanted the new Banning Lewis Ranch to feel like home. Like a community with a sense of place. So while we honor the closing of one chapter, we look forward to the opening of another; and we're glad you're a part of it.  Welcome to Banning Lewis Ranch.",
